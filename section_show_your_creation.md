# Show Your Creation

Show Your Creation is a section for members to share their own Minecraft related artistic works.

> Moderators should remove any content that isn't Minecraft related and issue a Friendly Rules Reminder to inform the member that any future posts in the section must be Minecraft related.

## Screenshots

### Embed Screenshots 

A collection of links is difficult to view, embedded images provide a much better user experience. Screenshots must be embedded using the `[img]` bbcode.

> Moderators should fix any posts that don't embed their screenshots and inform the member via Private Message how they can embed by providing a link to the FAQ.

## Videos

Members are permitted to post a new thread for each video they create or keep one thread updated with new videos in replies.

### Channel Linking

The videos section is for members share their videos, and others to find individual videos to watch. Each thread in the Videos section must contain at least one video, threads should not contain just a link to a YouTube channel.

> Moderators should remove a thread if it is just a link to a YouTube channel and a warning for Channel Linking should be issued.

## Art Shops and Requests

### Shop Reviews

Art Shop owners aren't permitted to post reviews of other shops because this can create a hostile environment and cause arguments amongst members. 

> Moderators should remove reviews posted by other Art Shop owners, if the review is inflammatory then a warning for Flame Baiting should be issued, otherwise a warning for Spamming should be issued.
