# Support

Support moderators help users find and receive high quality Minecraft support by sharing their Minecraft support knowledge and using their moderation tools to better enable the community to support them.

* Modify thread titles to improve clarity
* Add relevant prefixes to threads
* Format posts using spoilers to collapse crash reports
* Lock duplicate threads about service status
* Redirect bug reports to the [official Mojang Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC) with the [Bug Reporting 101 Guide](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/unmodified-minecraft-client/1855459-official-bug-reporting)
* Remove information from posts that could compromise a members security
* Remove threads from members seeking support for cracked launchers

Support moderators are encouraged to provide support in the Support section, and to have a presence in the [#minecrafthelp IRC channel on irc.esper.net](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/chat) to observe how certain issues are handled, and to obtain information on current issues impacting Minecraft players.

## Hijacking

Members must create their own thread to request support for the issue they're experiencing, they must not post requests for support in another members thread, this is called "Hijacking". Multiple requests for support in a single thread create confusion between the people requesting support and the people providing support.

> When a member hijacks a thread an informal warning should be issued. If the post contains enough information for support to be provided the post should be moved to a new thread in the section using the <kbd>Move</kbd> option, if the post contains no information it should be deleted.

## Support Status

After a support thread is finished with it should be locked to prevent further responses. If the support request must be made elsewhere (for example Mojang Support) then a reply should be given with a link to the correct place to request support, otherwise the Resolved prefix should be added to the thread.
