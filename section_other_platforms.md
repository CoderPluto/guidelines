# Other Platforms 

## General
* Suggestions
  * Mojang and 4J already actively look at features from the PC version of Minecraft for added new features to upcomming updates.  These sections are geared for new, original ideas instead of current game requests.
  * Moderation: Lock these threads with a message stating the Suggestion Section is for original ideas.

## Minecraft: Pocket Edition Mapping and Modding

* Porting Content from PC version of Minecraft.
  * It is not uncommon to see members "port" their favorite mods/textures from the PC version of Minecraft.  
  * Moderation: If the mod/textures the member is porting does not display they have recieved permission, or does not follow the mod/texture's license warn with reason: Stolen Content (MCPE) and hide the thread.  If the member provives they have proof, edit their thread to contain the permission and unhide the thread.

* Downloads from Online Stores
  * Links for downloads cannot come from a source such as Amazon/Google Play/Apple/online store.  This does not change if the App is free or paid.  A direct download must be offered.
  * Moderation: Remove link from thread and warn for Advertising.  If no other download link is given, hide the thread.

* SMP "hack" and "cheat" Mods for Multiplayer 
  * This includes all mods that are designed to bypass servers that have features such as flying, crafting, creative, ect... disabled.  Unlike the PC version of Minecraft, Pocket Edition is very limited with server protections, and threads that advertise mods that clearly state these mods will give them advantages, or to access features that are otherwise disabled devolve into flamewars and spam.  Mods that allow members to fly, access creative in survival, or otherwise "cheat" while playing in a single player world are still allowed.
  * Moderation: Hide the thread and warn "Other" stating that mods that are designed to bypass or target specific servers that disabled features for Multiplayer are not allowed.

## Minecraft: Console Edition General
* Mods/Map Downloads/Third Party Tools
  * Many members try to share maps/advertise servers that they have downloaded/originally came from PC Minecraft.  
  * Moderation: Remove thread and warn Modification (Console).
* Game Sharing
  * The term Game Sharing refers to having members share their login details for their consoles to be able to download the game onto multiple systems.  Not only is this promoting piracy, it is also very risky for member's private info.  Once logged onto the account, there is nothing stopping anyone else from using their account to purchase new items from the relavant console's stores, or changing the password to keep the account for themselves.
  * Moderation: Requests for game sharing should be warned with: Piracy Support / Request / Promotion and the thread hidden.

## Minecraft Console Editions Discussion
* Multiplayer Threads
  * A lot of Multiplayer threads show up in the Discussion sections.  
  * Moderation: Just move these threads to the corresponding Multiplayer section.  Only warn if the member continues to post in the Discussion sections.

## Minecraft: Console Editions Suggestions
* PC Mod Requests
  * A lot of suggestions are members requesting a mod from the PC version of Minecraft to be added to the game.
  * Moderation: Lock thread, state the section is for original ideas, but if there is a feature from a mod they would like to see added to the game to suggest that instead.  They may use the PC mod as a refrence when making their suggestion.

## Minecraft: Console Editions Multiplayer

* Multiple Multiplayer Threads
  * Consoles are unlike the PC and PE versions.  Servers are hosted on the members console, and are online only when the host is connected to the internet, and playing Minecraft.  Maps are small, and they change often.  To limit spam, members are allowed to create one thread for each type of game they play.  If a member wishes to switch to a new map, but continue to play the same game type, they must continue to use their Survival/Creative/Hunger Game thread they had previously created.
  * Example: One thread for Survival play.  One thread for Creative play.  One thread for Hunger Games.  ect...  
  * Moderation: If duplicates are found, remove all recent threads and warn for dulicate threads.  Explain in the warning they may only have one thread for their game type and link to their original thread and request they edit the thread it.

## Minecraft: Console Editions Show Your Creation
* Duplicate Threads
  * The console sections are very closely related.  If a member is sharing a video across multiple platforms, the video itself must be recorded from the console.  PlayStation Minecraft with Sony consoles and Xbox Minecraft with Microsoft consoles.
  * Moderation: If duplicates found across multiple platforms, remove duplicates that are not recorded on the corresponding console and warn for Duplicate Topics.

# Minecraft: PI
  * No special instructions.
