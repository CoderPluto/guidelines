## Suggestions

### Original Suggestions 

Mojang and 4J actively look at features from the PC version of Minecraft, the suggestions section is for original ideas that aren't already a part of another version of the game. Members can suggest things that exist in modded Minecraft and reference the existing mod but they must include specifics rather than simply suggest the mod is added.

> Moderators should lock threads that contain ideas from other versions of Minecraft with a message stating that the Suggestion section is for original ideas only.

## Minecraft: Pocket Edition Mapping and Modding

### Porting 

Members are allowed to port community created content from PC Minecraft to Pocket Edition if the content license permits or they have permission from the author. A mod is considered a port if it uses the assets, code or name of an existing mod, however using the same idea as an existing mod does not make the mod a port.

> Moderators should delete threads for content that has been ported without permission or does not abide by the terms of the license the original content was released under and a Stolen Content (MCPE) warning should be issued. A moderator can restore the thread if the member is ready to bring the content in compliance, either through adjustments to meet the license requirements or by obtaining permission from the original author.

### Downloads From Online Stores

Links for downloads cannot come from a source such as the Amazon, Google Play or Apple app stores, even if the app is free. Direct downloads are the only acceptable method for distributing content.

> Moderators should remove links to app store downloads from content threads and issue an Advertising warning. A moderator can restore the thread when the member is ready to add a direct download link to the thread.

### Cheat and Hack Mods For Multiplayer

The Minecraft Pocket Edition section does not permit mods that allow players to bypass restrictions on servers to give an unfair advantage or access to abilities not enabled by the server, such as creative in survival or allowing players to fly. Minecraft Pocket Edition servers are limited in the ways they can protect their servers and these mods are disruptive to others, and discussions about them frequently devolve into arguments.

> Moderators should delete threads for mods that enable players to cheat or hack in Multiplayer servers and issue an Other warning with an explanation of the rule.

## Minecraft: Console Edition General

### Game Sharing

Sharing account details so that others can download games they have not purchased onto their consoles is not allowed in public or private because it promotes piracy, and exposes individuals private information to theft.

> Moderators should delete any request for or offer of Game Sharing and issue a Piracy Support / Request / Promotion warning.

### Modifications

The Sony and Microsoft terms of service disallow modification of game content, which includes content such as maps, mods, resource packs and tools. Distributing or requesting modified console content is not allowed on the forum.

> Moderators should deleted threads containing downloads and a Modification (Console) warning should be issued.

## Minecraft: Console Editions Multiplayer

### Duplicate Multiplayer Threads

Consoles are unlike the PC and PE versions, servers are hosted on the members console and are online only when the host is playing Minecraft. Members are allowed to create one thread per game type they play and must use that thread even when they change the map. For example a thread for Survival, a thread for Creative and a thread for Hunger Games.

> Moderators should delete the duplicate threads and issue a Duplicate Threads warning, leaving behind the first thread created for that game type. The warning message should explain that members are only permitted to create one thread per game type and include a link to the first thread they created for that game type.
