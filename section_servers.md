## Banned Entities

The servers section has banned entities, these users, hosts, servers, and websites have been banned from the forum because of serious or continuous rule violations. Banned Entities are kept track of on the [Trello board of the same name](https://trello.com/b/nPUMSuW6/banned-entities) which is managed by the Forum Administrators. When a banned entity makes an appearance on the forum a card should be created in the To Do list on the [Forum Moderation](https://trello.com/b/VP7ordvf/forum-moderation) so that the section administrator can take action.

## What is bumping?

Posting in a thread with the sole intention of bringing the thread back to the top of the section without providing any additional content to the thread is bumping. The forum does not permit bumping because it benefits the thread author at the expense of other forum users by giving the impression that there is a new content in the thread. The most common form that bumps take is a post containing just the word "bump", however some members are more sophisticated and may bump with posts such as "We're still looking for players!" or "There are 10 people online". The easiest way to differentiate a bump from a legitimate post is to consider whether or not the post provides any value for visitors to the thread. 

## Acceptable 'bump schemes'

Certain posts may seem like bumping but they are permitted.

* Encouraging members to post their Minecraft username to receive access to the server or a specific rank. This is permitted because it allows server owners to use their Minecraft Forum thread to manage applications to access their server, and communicates to visitors which servers are popular.
* Posting about a major update, information that impacts a lot of players. For example announcing a new website or significant changes to the server. Frequent changes that have limited impact, such as packages selling out or additional builds on the server are not considered major updates.

## Minecraft Server Hosts

Server Hosts are permitted to bump their threads following the same guidelines as the PC Servers section, where they can post about major updates but must not use minor changes, such as sold out packages or new staff announcements, to bump their thread.
