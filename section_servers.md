## Bumping

Posting in a thread with the sole intention of bringing the thread back to the top of the section without providing any additional content to the thread is bumping. The forum does not permit bumping because it benefits the thread author at the expense of other forum users by giving the impression that there is a new content in the thread. The most common form that bumping takes is a post containing just the word "bump", however some members are more sophisticated and may bump with posts such as "We're still looking for players!" or "There are 10 people online". The easiest way to differentiate a bump from a legitimate post is to consider whether or not the post provides any value for visitors to the thread. 

### Exceptions

Some posts that may appear to be bumping are permitted.

* Encouraging members to post their Minecraft username to receive access to the server or a specific rank. This is permitted because it allows server owners to use their Minecraft Forum thread to manage applications to access their server, and communicates to visitors which servers are popular.
* Posting about a major update, information that impacts a lot of players. For example announcing a new website or significant changes to the server. Frequent changes that have limited impact, such as packages selling out or additional builds on the server are not considered major updates.

## Minecraft Server Hosts

The Minecraft Server Hosting section is a restricted section which requires an application to advertise in. The application process is outlined in the [How to advertise your Minecraft Server Host on the Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers/minecraft-server-hosting/2608188-how-to-advertise-your-minecraft-server-host-on-the) sticky thread in the section. Threads made elsewhere on the forum advertising a Minecraft Server Host must not be moved into this section.

Server Hosts are permitted to bump their threads following the same guidelines as the PC Servers section, where they can post about major updates but must not use minor changes, such as sold out packages or new staff announcements, to bump their thread.
