# Servers 

##Banned Entities
The servers section has banned entities. These users, hosts, servers, and even sites have been warned repeatedly and have continuously violated the Minecraft Forum rules. When they did that, they were banned from the Minecraft Forum. They've continued to bypass bans and they've tried to bypass our banning by giving their servers/hosts different names. If you see a banned entity, you need to delete the thread and contact the Servers Forum Admin (Lord_Ralex) immediately.

##The merge with the Server List

##What is bumping?

Bumping happens when a host, user, or server 'bumps' their server up to the top of the list by posting useless content. Bumps can be as simple as "BUMP!!!!" or spamming characters. Bumping misrepresents the topic making it seem like it's active when it really isn't. 

##Acceptable 'bump schemes'

Certain types of posts may seem like bumping however, they are allowed. Certain bumping schemes that are allowed are:
* Post your name to get a supporter rank. An example would be "Post your name and you'll get the Cobble rank!" then having users post their username. It may seem like bumping, however, it's allowed because it's not the server misrepresenting the topic.
* Posting about major updates. An example being "We added 107 new plugins, removed 27, promoted 8 players to admin, 4 players to mod, and added an additional 27 servers". That would be considered a major update but be careful, there are some servers that will try to trick you by doing "Added mob farm!" "Added TeamSpeak!" "Built a public area". Those aren't considered major updates, they're considered bumping.

##Server Hosts

Servers looks over one of the more interesting sections, the hosts forum. In this forum, hosts are able to advertise their services in an attempt to sell their servers to users. Hosts can be difficult to moderate however working as a team, we're able to do it. Just like the servers forum, there are certain bump schemes that are allowed for hosts. They're basically the same thing however, some hosts will try to get away with "Sold out of cobble package!" "Added new support rep. everyone welcome Sam!" "Anyone need help with their services?" and that's simply bumping. 


In general, Servers is a great section to moderate however it's not an easy one. Welcome to the Servers team, as long as we all work together, we can keep the Servers section clean and enjoyable for everyone!
