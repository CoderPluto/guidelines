# Servers 

##Banned Entities
The servers section has banned entities. These users, hosts, servers, and even sites have been warned repeatedly and have continuously violated the Minecraft Forum rules. When they did that, they were banned from the Minecraft Forum. They've continued to bypass bans and they've tried to bypass our banning by giving their servers/hosts different names. If you see anyone on the banned entities list, you need to go to the Moderation board on Trello and create a new card under "Todo" with the information and make yourself and Lord_Ralex members of the card. You could also link that card to their card ont he Banned Entities board.

##The merge with the Server List

##What is bumping?

Bumping is when there's a post on a thread bringing it to the top of the threads list when there's no active discussion going on it. Bumping misrepresents the thread which may confuse members so they'll think a thread is active when it really isn't. Bumps can be anything that doesn't relate to the topic however, it's common the bump just says "bump".

##Acceptable 'bump schemes'

Certain types of posts may seem like bumping however, they are allowed. Certain bumping schemes that are allowed are:
* Post your name to get a supporter rank. An example would be "Post your name and you'll get the Cobble rank!" then having users post their username. It may seem like bumping, however, it's allowed because it's not the server misrepresenting the topic.
* Posting a major update. A major update can be defined as something that impacts a lot of the players. An example of a major update being "We added forums and a TeamSpeak come chat with us!" while "Sold out of cobble package" or "I added mob farm for donators" would not be considered a major update.

If the bump is an acceptable scheme, it isn't misrepresenting the thread, it's simply informing the members that there has been a rather large update that they should check out since it does effect everyone. Whereas the minor update only effects a select few so it's misrepresenting the thread for a large majority of the members.

##Server Hosts
Just like the servers forum, there are certain bump schemes that are allowed for hosts. They're basically the same thing however, some hosts will try to get away with "Sold out of cobble package!" "Added new support rep. everyone welcome Sam!" "Anyone need help with their services?" and that's simply bumping.
