# Servers

## Bumping

Some posts that may appear to be bumping in the Servers section are permitted:

* Encouraging members to post their Minecraft username to receive access to the server or a specific rank. This is permitted because it allows server owners to use their Minecraft Forum thread to manage applications to access their server, and communicates to visitors which servers are popular.
* Posting about a major update, information that impacts a lot of players. For example announcing a new website or significant changes to the server. Frequent changes that have limited impact, such as packages selling out or additional builds on the server are not considered major updates.

## Minecraft Server Hosts

The Minecraft Server Hosting section is a restricted section which requires an application to advertise in. The application process is outlined in the [How to advertise your Minecraft Server Host on the Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers/minecraft-server-hosting/2608188-how-to-advertise-your-minecraft-server-host-on-the) sticky thread in the section.

> Moderators **must not** move threads to the Minecraft Server Hosting section, any thread advertising a Minecraft Server Host made elsewhere on the forum must be deleted and an Advertising warning should be issued.
