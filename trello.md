# Forum Management With Trello

Trello is a task management application that we use to help with management of the forum: staff members can assign tasks to others and keep track of the tasks they're responsible for, with tasks organised across different boards for different sections of management.

Visit [trello.com/signup][trello-signup] to create an account, then add your Minecraft Forum username to your Bio via [Account Details][trello-account]. After you've registered your Trello account your Forum Administrator will add you to the organisation. Trello is very straight forward and you should be able to get started right away, but if you'd like to learn more before diving in then there are many guides provided by Trello, covering everything from [getting started with Trello][trello-guide] to [becoming a Trello pro][trello-pro]. Experienced staff members are happy to answer any questions you have too.
