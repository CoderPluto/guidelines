# Staff Responsibilities

The Minecraft Forum Staff are responsible for ensuring that the Minecraft Forum is an excellent resource for Minecraft players to learn about the game, discover new content and share their creations, while fostering a friendly and welcoming environment for all.

Site Administrators are responsible for identifying the needs of staff, members and users, and using this information to shape the forum, including forum organisation, features and policy. Site Administrators work with the Curse development and product teams on designing the software used by the forum, representing the needs of the Minecraft Forum community in these discussions.

Forum Administrators are responsible for individual forum sections, they manage and support the section moderators, make decisions about section structure and serve as the Site Administrators point of contact. Forum Administrators work together with the Site Administrators to manage appeals and member support.

Moderators contribute towards ensuring that their assigned section(s) are clean and well organised by removing rule violating posts, organising threads into the correct sections and helping members understand and follow the forum rules with warnings.
Moderators are encouraged to use their experience and expertise in their areas of interest to work with the Forum and Site Administrators to identify ways the forum can be improved.
