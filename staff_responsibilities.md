# Staff Responsibilities

The Minecraft Forum Staff are responsible for ensuring that the Minecraft Forum is an excellent resource for Minecraft players to learn about the game, discover new content and share their creations, while fostering a friendly and welcoming community for all.

Site Administrators are responsible for identifying the needs of staff, members and users, and using this information to shape the the forum, including forum organisation, features and policy.

Forum Administrators are responsible for individual forum sections, they manage the moderators of the section, make decisions about section structure and serve as the Site Administrators point of contact for the section. Forum Administrators work together with the Site Administrator to provide support to members, through the forum support section and appeals. Forum Administrators work with the Moderators to ensure they know how to properly and efficently do their job. They also work on training new Moderators.

Moderators contribute towards ensuring that their assigned section(s) are clean and well organised. Moderators do so by removing rule violating posts, organising threads into the correct sections and helping members understand and follow the forum rules with warnings. Moderators are encouraged to help identify ways in which their sections can be improved and work with their Forum Administrator to achieve this.
