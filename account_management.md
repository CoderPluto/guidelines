# Account Management & Password Security

Password security is very important, even more so when your password protects an account that has elevated access. Minecraft Forum staff have access to a wide variety of tools and private information on the forum and therefore need to take password security seriously, please read [Password Do's and Don'ts](http://krebsonsecurity.com/password-dos-and-donts/) before choosing your Minecraft Forum password.

The Minecraft Forum Control Panel is protected by [2 Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication), staff must verify their identity using their mobile phone when logging into the Control Panel from a new IP Address. A mobile phone number can be set via [My Account](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account) from a whitelisted IP. Staff members without access to a mobile phone for 2 Factor Authentication should speak to a site administrator about alternatives.

## Account Compromises

Staff members should always err on the side of caution and inform administrators of any concerns they have about their account security, this includes Minecraft Forum accounts, Email accounts and Trello accounts. Administrators must be informed immediately when there has been a compromise so that the Minecraft Forum account access can be locked down.
