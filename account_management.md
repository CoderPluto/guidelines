# Account Management & Password Security

Strong password security is very important on the internet, even more so when your password protects an account that has elevated access to a system. Minecraft Forum staff have access to a wide variety of tools and information on the forum and therefore need to take password security seriously. You **MUST** use a unique password for your Minecraft Forum account, it **MUST NOT** be used for any other account. This also applies to email accounts, you **MUST** use a unique password for your email account, and where possible you should enable 2 Factor Auth for your email account.

The Minecraft Forum Control Panel is protected by [2 Factor Authentication][2fa], staff must verify their identity using their mobile phone when logging into the Control Panel for the first time from a new IP Address. A mobile phone number can be set via "[My Account][my-account]" from a whitelisted IP. Staff members without access to a mobile phone for 2 Factor Authentication should speak to a site administrator about alternatives.
