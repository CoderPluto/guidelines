# Warnings

## Appeals  

Members can submit appeals if they feel that a warning has been issued incorrectly. You'll be able to see the user who submitted the appeal, the type of appeal (warning, ban, etc), the description for the appeal, and links to all the necessary information. You can view appeals in the [moderation control panel](http://www.minecraftforum.net/cp/appeals), however moderators are not permitted to participate in the appeal process unless asked by an administrator on an appeal by appeal basis.

## Bans

A ban is a restriction on a members account. These restrictions can affect posting, visiting and interacting with the forum. When you issue a formal warning to someone they receive warning points dependent on the Warning Definition. These points are then used to trigger automatic posting bans, and the length of a posting depends on the amount of points.

| Points | Posting Ban |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | No ban |
| 2 | 3 Days |
| 3 | 5 Days |
| 4 | 7 Days |
| 5 | 14 Days | 
| 6+ | 30 Days |

## Member Administrative Reviews (MARs)

If a member repeatedly breaks the forum rules or behaves in a manner that raises concerns about their presence on the forum then a Member Administrative Review can be conducted. Any member of staff can create a Member Administrative Review on the Forum Moderation board following the guidelines outlined in the [Member Administrative Review](https://trello.com/c/4c3Dy6jJ/1867-member-administrative-review) card. 

There are no criteria for when a member should have an Member Administrative Review, it is up to each individual staff member to decide if they think one is neccessary. Usually when a member reaches 4 or more warnings in a short period of time a MAR will be created.
