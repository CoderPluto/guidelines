# Warnings

The warning system is an on the record way to communicate with members about the Minecraft Forum rules, each warning is an opportunity for a member to learn more about the forum rules, they are not a punishment. Staff members must treat each warning discussion as an opportunity to help the recipient better understand the rules, replying to questions or concerns raised by a member in response to a warning is just as important as issuing warnings. Staff members should escalate a Private Message conversation about a warning if they're unable to provide the information the member needs.

## Appeals  

Members can submit appeals if they feel that a warning has been issued incorrectly. You'll be able to see the user who submitted the appeal, the type of appeal (warning, ban, etc), the description for the appeal, and links to all the necessary information. You can view appeals in the [moderation control panel](http://www.minecraftforum.net/cp/appeals), however moderators are not permitted to participate in the appeal process unless asked by an administrator on an appeal by appeal basis.

## Bans

A ban is a restriction on a members account. These restrictions can affect posting, visiting and interacting with the forum. When you issue a formal warning to someone they receive warning points dependent on the Warning Definition. These points are then used to trigger automatic posting bans, and the length of a posting depends on the amount of points.

| Points | Posting Ban |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | No ban |
| 2 | 3 Days |
| 3 | 5 Days |
| 4 | 7 Days |
| 5 | 14 Days | 
| 6+ | 30 Days |

## Member Administrative Reviews (MARs)

If a member repeatedly breaks the forum rules or behaves in a manner that raises concerns about their presence on the forum then a Member Administrative Review can be conducted. Any member of staff can create a Member Administrative Review on the Forum Moderation board following the guidelines outlined in the [Member Administrative Review](https://trello.com/c/4c3Dy6jJ/1867-member-administrative-review) card. 

There are no criteria for when a member should have an Member Administrative Review, it is up to each individual staff member to decide if they think one is neccessary. Usually when a member reaches 4 or more warnings in a short period of time a MAR will be created.

## How to issue a warning

## Informal v Formal

When issuing a warning, you can either issue an informal warning or a formal warning. Some warning types don't allow you to choose an informal (Like profanity or piracy). If a warning has an informal option, you'll want to first check to see if they have any warnings. If they don't, choose the informal option however if they've been warned before, you'll choose the formal. The difference between a formal warning and an informal warning is a formal warning adds warning points and an informal is more of a "slap on the wrist". 

## What information to include in the message

Most of the warning types have an automated message that will describe the rule being broken however if you use a Friendly Rule Reminder, there isn't one. You'll have to write your own. You'll want to include the rule they broke and how they broke it.

## Private comments

Private comments can be left as little notes. If they appeal, you'll be able to have things there that you might need. If you're issuing a duplicate thread warning, you could leave links to the other threads or if they sent malware, you can leave the virus scan there. 

## Dealing with incorrectly issued warnings

"Be proactive not reactive"

If you issue an incorrect warning, own up to it. It always looks better to own up to a mistake than get called out for it. If you issue an incorrect warning, you'll want to inform the user that you're getting the warning revoked (You can inform them by responding to the warning PM) then you'll want to post a card on Trello under the Forum Moderation board in the "To Do" list.
