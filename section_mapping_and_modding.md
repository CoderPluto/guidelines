# Mapping and Modding

## Abandoned/Outdated Content

There is 2 states which a mod can be in:
- Active: Development of the mod is ongoing and/or the modder is participating in the thread
- Abandoned: Development of the mod has stopped due to the modder announcing they are no longer updating the mod or the modder no longer actively participating in the thread

If a mod is adandoned, it may be locked at a time to which no more activity on the thread would provide benefit. 
If a modder announces they will not continue a mod anymore, the thread should remain open for a few months so that users can still talk about the mod (assuming the mod was recently active).
If a mod is several versions behind and shows no signs of it being updated, it may be locked if users are necro-posting on it. 

When a thread is locked due to it being abandoned, please use the following template:

>Due to the appearance that this mod is no longer being worked on and that it is adandoned, this thread is now being locked. Should the author wish for this thread to be unlocked, the author can report this post and explain in the report they would like for the thread to be unlocked.

## Update "Spam"

Update spam is any request to an author requesting that a mod be updated (or backported), or posts which ask for status updates.

Examples can include:
- "Will this be updated for X?"
- "When is Y coming out"
- "Can you make a version for Z"
