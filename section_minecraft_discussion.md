# Minecraft Discussion

Any thread made to advertise a Minecraft Server in any Minecraft Discussion section should be issued a formal Wrong Section Servers warning. Formal warnings are used because members are usually aware it's the wrong section and make the thread anyway because of the additional exposure their server will receive.

## Suggestions

Replies to suggestions must be constructive criticism of the suggestion or offer ideas on how to expand the original idea, posts containing just `Support` or `No Support` aren't constructive and should be removed.

### Wishlists

A wishlist is a thread with a series of unrelated suggestions, multiple items per suggestion are permitted as long as they are related, wishlists aren't allowed because they don't tend to produce constructive discussion. For example a suggestion about a gardening update featuring new plants, tools, and gardening type blocks would be allowed. However, a suggestion featuring a new dragon mob, emerald armor, and new command block commands would not be allowed. Wishlists should be locked with a reply informing the user they must create an individual thread for each suggestion.

### Duplicate Suggestions

Suggestions should be limited to one active thread at a time, an active thread is one that has had a post made within the last month. A new thread about an active suggestion should be locked with a link provided to the active thread, where the member is encouraged to expand on the idea in a reply.

## Seeds

Seeds must be for the Vanilla Minecraft game, and must be included in the opening post of the thread. Any thread not meeting these requirements should be deleted.
