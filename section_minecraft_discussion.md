# Minecraft Discussion

Minecraft Discussion does not permit threads advertising Minecraft Servers, visitors do not visit the Minecraft Discussion to find Minecraft Servers.

> Moderators should delete any thread made to advertise a server in any Minecraft Discussion section and issue a formal Wrong Section Servers warning. Formal warnings are used because members are usually aware it's the wrong section and make the thread anyway because of the additional exposure their server will receive.

## Suggestions

Replies to suggestions must be constructive criticism of the suggestion or offer ideas on how to expand the original idea, posts containing just `Support` or `No Support` aren't constructive.

> Moderators should delete any post that isn't constructive, a member who is persistently making posts that aren't constructive should be issued a Spamming warning.

### Wishlists

A wishlist is a thread with a series of unrelated suggestions, multiple items per suggestion are permitted as long as they are related, wishlists aren't allowed because they don't tend to produce constructive discussion. For example a suggestion about a gardening update featuring new plants, tools, and gardening type blocks would be allowed. However, a suggestion featuring a new dragon mob, emerald armor, and new command block commands would not be allowed. 

> Moderators should lock Wishlists and reply informing the user they must create an individual thread for each suggestion.

### Duplicate Suggestions

Suggestions should be limited to one active thread at a time, an active thread is one that has had a post made within the last month. 

> Moderators should lock new threads created about an active suggestion and reply with a link to the active thread and encourage the member to expand on the idea in a reply.

## Seeds

Seeds must be for the Vanilla Minecraft game, and must be included in the opening post of the thread. 

> Moderators should delete any thread that does not meet these requirements.
