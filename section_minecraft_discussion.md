## Suggestions
* Wishlist threads
  * A 'wishlist' thread is a thread with a series of unrelated suggestions. We don't allow threads like this because they tend to not generate good discussion. We do allow multiple items per suggestion, as long as they are related. 
  * Example: A suggestion about a gardening update feature new plants, tools, and gardening type blocks __would__ be allowed. However, a suggestion featuring a new dragon mob, emerald armor, and new command block commands __would not__ be allowed.
  * Moderating: Post in the thread informing the user that wish list type threads aren't allowed and that thye should repost each suggestion separately
* "Support" / "No support"
  * Posts like "Support" or "No support" are considered 'low effort'. Posts should be constructive criticism of the suggestion or offer ideas on how to expand the original suggestion
  * Moderating: Remove the post
* Duplicate/redundant suggestions
  * If a thread copies another active suggestion thread it is considered a duplicate or redundant
  * A suggestion is considered 'active' if there has been a post made within the last calender month
  * Moderating: Post in the thread informing the user to use the other thread to expand the idea. Post a link to the active thread and lock the offending thread
