# Moderation Tools

* Staff-only account preferences:  
    Moderators have a few hidden account options specific to moderation. They can be changed at http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/preferences.
    
    Show deleted content: whether or not to show deleted threads/posts. You should always have this enabled.   
    Show content marked as spam: whether or not to show threads/posts that have been marked as spam.    

* Moving threads:   
    To move a thread to a different section of the forum, click on "Tools > Move thread". Select the forum section you wish to move the thread to, then click "Move thread". If you wish to leave a redirect notice in the section where the thread was previously located, select the "Leave a redirect notice on the original forum" checkbox, then enter the duration of the notice. Moderators are allowed to decide on the duration of the notice, but the general guidelines are:

  If a thread has no replies, do not use a redirect notice.   
  If a thread is under 2 hours old, a 2 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.   
  If a thread has over 20 replies (2+ pages), a 12 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.   
  If a thread is very active (5+ pages), a 24 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.    

* Locking threads:  
    Locking a thread prevents other members from posting on it. To lock a thread, click on "Tools > Lock thread". Administrators and other moderators are still allowed to post in locked threads. You should always leave a lock message, unless the original poster has asked for the thread to be locked.

* Deleting threads:  
    Deleting a thread hides it from view of other forum members. To delete a thread, click on "Tools > Delete thread". Administrators and other moderators in your section are still allowed to view deleted threads.

* Viewing post history:  
    The post history feature allows you to view all revisions made on a particular post. To view the edit history of a post, click on "Tools > Post history" in the dropdown-box near the bottom of the post. You can also rollback a post to a previous revision by using the "Rollback post to revision" list. Select the version you want to rollback to, then click the "RollBack" button.

* What is spam, and how to mark a post as spam:  
    Spam are posts (or threads) generally created by new accounts that has been made for the sole purpose of advertising non-Minecraft content. To mark a thread as spam, click on "Tools > Mark as spam", use "Tools > Spam" for posts. Do not mark posts such as "bump" or "lol" as spam! The automatic spam filter learns posts that have been marked as spam, and incorrectly marking posts may cause legitimate posts to be marked as spam.
