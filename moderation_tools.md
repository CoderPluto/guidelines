# Moderation Tools

## Account Preferences

Moderators have access to additional options, these options are managed via [My Account > Preferences](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/preferences).
    
* Show Deleted Content 
* Show Content Marked as Spam
* Show Hellban Content
* Show Censored Content

These options should always be enabled because effective moderation depends on having all relevant information, which can often be within hidden posts.

## Reports

Members report items (such as posts, members, comments, servers) by selecting from a list of pre-defined reasons and providing any relevant information in the report description. Each pre-defined reason has a description to explain to the member when that report reason is appropriate to use.

### Statuses

Reports enter the system with the **new** status and from there moderators change the status as the report is acted on.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **New** | Nobody has acted on this report yet |
| **Under Review** | A moderator is currently working on this report |
| **Escalated** | A specific staff member is responsible for this report |
| **Resolved** | The issue has been investigated and resolved |
| **Declined** | The reported issue was not valid |

### Escalating a Report

Some reports require input from or action by a specific member of staff, however the report system does not have native support for assigning reports. To work around this issue we use Trello and the Escalated report status. A card should be created and assigned to the staff member on the [Forum Moderation Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/VP7ordvf/forum-moderation) with a link to the report attached, then the report should be marked as Escalated with a comment linking to the Trello card.

## Status Notes

Status notes are used to communicate information about a thread to visitors or staff. A public status note is visible to everyone who visits the thread, a private status note is only visible to staff members. A status note can be added using the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu or using the Reason option when deleting an item.

## Moving Threads

Click <kbd>Move Thread</kbd> from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu in the thread, then select the destination forum from the list. If you wish to leave a Redirect Notice in the section where the thread is currently located select "Leave a redirect notice on the original forum" and enter the duration the Redirect Notice should remain for. Moderators decide on the duration using the following guidelines:

* If a thread has no replies do not use a redirect notice.
* If a thread is under 2 hours old a 2 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.
* If a thread has over 20 replies (2+ pages) a 12 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.
* If a thread is very active (5+ pages) a 24 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.

Redirect notices should be used when it's likely that people will visit the section expecting to find the thread, and if a thread is very popular it is quite likely this will happen.

## Locking Threads

Locking a thread prevents other members from posting in it. To lock a thread, click on <kbd>Lock thread</kbd> from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu in the thread. After a thread has been locked a comment should be made explaining why it has been locked, unless the original poster has asked for the thread to be locked.

## Deleting Content

The <kbd>Delete</kbd> option hides content from public view and collapses the content for staff members. To delete content use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> option in the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu, optionally leaving a Reason.

## Post History 

To view the history of a post, including all changes made by the author and moderators, click on <kbd>Post History</kbd> in the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu. From the drop down menu of revisions you can preview by selecting a revision, and Rollback to a revision if neccessary. 

## Spam

The forum's built-in spam filter can automatically marks posts as spam when they're created, and learns from posts that are marked as spam by staff members. For example, if a post containing "Football" is marked as spam, then the next time a post containing "Football" is posted, the filter is more likely to consider that post spam. Content must only be marked as spam when it is content that we want the filter to automatically identify as spam, for example posts advertising VIAGRAÂ®.

Spam is posts (or threads) generally created by new accounts that has been made for the sole purpose of advertising non-Minecraft content. To mark a thread as spam, from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu select <kbd>Mark as Spam</kbd> for Threads and <kbd>Spam</kbd> for posts. Do not mark posts such as "bump" or "lol" as spam, because the automatic spam filter learns from posts that have been marked as spam, and incorrectly marking posts may cause legitimate posts to be marked as spam. If you're not sure if something qualifies as spam please speak to an administrator.
