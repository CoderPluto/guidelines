# Moderation Tools
* Moving threads:   
    To move a thread to a different section of the forum, click on "Tools > Move thread". Select the forum section you wish to move the thread to, then click "Move thread". If you wish to leave a redirect notice in the section where the thread was previously located, select the "Leave a redirect notice on the original forum" checkbox, then enter the duration of the notice. Moderators are allowed to decide on the duration of the notice, but the general guidelines are:

  If a thread has no replies, do not use a redirect notice.   
  If a thread is under 2 hours old, a 2 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.   
  If a thread has over 20 replies (2+ pages), a 12 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.   
  If a thread is very active (5+ pages), a 24 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.    

* Locking threads:  
    Locking a thread prevents other members from posting on it. To lock a thread, click on "Tools > Lock thread". Administrators and other moderators are still allowed to post in locked threads. You should always leave a lock message, unless the original poster has asked for the thread to be locked.

* Deleting threads:  
    Deleting a thread hides it from view of other forum members. To delete a thread, click on "Tools > Delete thread". Administrators and other moderators in your section are still allowed to view deleted threads.
