# Moderation Tools

* Staff-only account preferences:  
    Moderators have a few hidden account options specific to moderation. They can be changed at http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/preferences.
    
    Show deleted content: whether or not to show deleted threads/posts. You should always have this enabled.   
    Show content marked as spam: whether or not to show threads/posts that have been marked as spam.    

* Report types and statuses, and escalating reports:  
    You will encounter various types of reports while moderating. The types are:

    Move/Delete my post: The reporter wishes to have the post either moved or deleted. Do not delete posts if the poster and reporter are different, unless the reporter has a valid explanation.
    Wrong section: The post is in the wrong forum section, and needs to be moved.
    Duplicate post: The reported post is a copy of another post. The reporter will usually include the link to the copied post.
    Spam: The post may be spam. Posts like "+1" are considered spam. 
    Bumping: The post may be bumping the thread it's in.
    Invalid suggestion: The thread may be an invalid suggestion. Mostly used in the Suggestions section.
    Flaming: The post may be rude or abrasive to others.
    Profanity or inappropriate material: The post may contain profanity or other inappropriate material such as nudity.
    Stolen content: The post may contain stolen or unlicensed content.
    Virus or malware: The post may contain (or link to) malware or viruses. Always temporarily delete the post while working on it!
    
    Reports also have different statuses, they are:
    
    New: A moderator has not handled this report yet.
    Under review: A moderator is currently working on this report.
    Escalated: A particular individual is responsible for this report, usually stated in the report's comment section.
    Resolved: This report was taken by a moderator and the issue has been fixed.
    Declined: The report was not valid and has been declined by the moderator.
    
    If only a particular person can handle a report, you may escalate a report to that person. Leave a comment saying who you've escalated the report to (i.e "I am escalating this to citricsquid"), then mark the report as escalated.

* Status notes:  
    You may add status notes to a post by clicking on "Tools > Add public note", or by selecting "Public reason?" when deleting a post. Moderators are not allowed to add status notes until further notice - if you mistakenly add a status note, please let an administrator know.

* Moving threads:   
    To move a thread to a different section of the forum, click on "Tools > Move thread". Select the forum section you wish to move the thread to, then click "Move thread". If you wish to leave a redirect notice in the section where the thread was previously located, select the "Leave a redirect notice on the original forum" checkbox, then enter the duration of the notice. Moderators are allowed to decide on the duration of the notice, but the general guidelines are:

  If a thread has no replies, do not use a redirect notice.   
  If a thread is under 2 hours old, a 2 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.   
  If a thread has over 20 replies (2+ pages), a 12 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.   
  If a thread is very active (5+ pages), a 24 hour redirect notice is the maximum acceptable.    

* Locking threads:  
    Locking a thread prevents other members from posting on it. To lock a thread, click on "Tools > Lock thread". Administrators and other moderators are still allowed to post in locked threads. You should always leave a lock message, unless the original poster has asked for the thread to be locked.

* Deleting threads:  
    Deleting a thread hides it from view of other forum members. To delete a thread, click on "Tools > Delete thread". Administrators and other moderators in your section are still allowed to view deleted threads.

* Viewing post history:  
    The post history feature allows you to view all revisions made on a particular post. To view the edit history of a post, click on "Tools > Post history" in the dropdown-box near the bottom of the post. You can also rollback a post to a previous revision by using the "Rollback post to revision" list. Select the version you want to rollback to, then click the "RollBack" button.

* How the spam system works:
    The forum's built-in spam filter learns posts that have been marked as spam, and is more likely to automatically mark similar posts as spam. For example, if a post containing "Football" is marked as spam, then the next time a post with "Football" is posted, the filter is more likely to consider that post spam. Do not mark threads such as server advertisements or mod threads that have been double-posted, for example, as we don't want the spam filter to accidentally mark legitimate threads as spam.

* What is spam, and how to mark a post as spam:  
    Spam are posts (or threads) generally created by new accounts that has been made for the sole purpose of advertising non-Minecraft content. To mark a thread as spam, click on "Tools > Mark as spam", use "Tools > Spam" for posts. Do not mark posts such as "bump" or "lol" as spam! The automatic spam filter learns posts that have been marked as spam, and incorrectly marking posts may cause legitimate posts to be marked as spam.

* Appeals:  
    Members can submit appeals if they feel that a warning has been issued incorrectly. You'll be able to see the user who submitted the appeal, the type of appeal (warning, ban, etc), the description for the appeal, and links to all the necessary information. You can view appeals in your moderation control panel at http://www.minecraftforum.net/cp/appeals, however, do not participate in the appeals process unless an administrator asks you to.

* Bans:
    A ban is a restriction on a members account. These restrictions can affect posting, visiting and interacting with the forum. A posting restriction is also considered a type of ban. When you issue a formal warning to someone, they are given warning points. These points are then used to trigger automatic posting bans. Note that permanent bans are never automatically issued. Points also expire automatically after thirty days. The point levels and ban lengths are as follows:
    
    2 points: 3 day ban from posting.    
    3 points: 5 day ban from posting.    
    4 points: 7 day ban from posting.    
    5 points: 14 day ban from posting.    
    6+ points: 30 day bans from posting.    

* Member Administrative Reviews (MARs):
    If a member constantly breaks the forum's rules, you may ask an administrator to review his account to discuss consequences and possibly a more severe punishment. There is no set number of warnings as to when a member should have a MAR, but 4+ warnings usually warrants a review. To sumbit a member for a MAR, simply add a card to the "Member Administrative Review" list on the "Forum Moderation" board on Trello with the member's username in the title, and a summary as to why you're reporting them, and any relevant links such as to previous warnings or a post they may have made.
