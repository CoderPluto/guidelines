## Bumping

Posting in a thread with the sole intention of bringing the thread back to the top of the section without providing any additional content to the thread is bumping. The forum does not permit bumping because it benefits the thread author at the expense of other forum users by giving the impression that there is a new content in the thread and pushing threads with new content further down the list.

The most common form that bumping takes is a post containing just the word "bump", however some members are more sophisticated and may bump with posts tangentially related to the subject but without value. For example in Servers more sophisticated bumping can take the form of "We're still looking for players!" or "There are 10 people online". The easiest way to differentiate a bump from a legitimate post is to consider whether or not the post provides any value for visitors to the thread, both new and returning.

> Moderators should delete bumping posts and issue a Bumping warning. A Member Administrative Review should be created if a member has been warned multiple times for bumping or if they've bumped a single thread a substantial amount -- more than 20 posts.
