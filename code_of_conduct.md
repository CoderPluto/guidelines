# Staff Code of Conduct

Minecraft Forum staff members represent the Minecraft Forum both on and off the forum, and their behaviour must reflect on the high standards we hold ourselves to.

## Privacy

The privacy of each member of the forum must be respected at all times regardless of their behaviour. Any private information must not be disclosed to any non staff member without the members explicit permission. Private information includes warnings, IP addresses, email addresses, reports and private discussions.

## Transparency

Moderation and management policy, decisions and procedures should be transparent between forum staff and members. Staff members are encouraged to provide insight into the inner workings of the forum to any member interested, and to involve the community in decisions that impact their use of the forum. 

## Conflicts of Interest

Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest must be addressed by escalating to a staff member who does not have any perceived or actual conflict. For example moderators should not moderate their own threads, and administrators should not handle appeals against warnings they have issued.
